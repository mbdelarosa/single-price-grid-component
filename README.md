## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

Getting used to Grid and its behavior, particularly the use of `grid-column: 1 / span 2` for the desktop view to make the first `section` span two columns and push the remaining sections to the next row

### Continued development

Looking forward to utilizing Grid again in future challenges to familiarize myself with its behavior and best practices
